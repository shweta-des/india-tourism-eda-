## Project Overview

This project analyzes **23 years** (2001-2023) of India's tourism data to understand:
- Long-term growth trends and patterns
- COVID-19 impact and recovery dynamics
- Geographic distribution and market shifts
- Economic contribution (Foreign Exchange Earnings)

**Key Finding:** Tourism in India fell sharply in 2020 due to COVID-19(65% crash), but recovered strongly and surpassed pre-pandemic levels by 2023. By then, total arrivals were 6% higher than in 2019, with Bangladesh becoming the largest source of foreign tourists.
